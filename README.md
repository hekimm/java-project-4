# Hypotenuse Calculator

A straightforward Java console application that calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the two perpendicular sides. Ideal for educational purposes to demonstrate the application of the Pythagorean theorem in programming.

## Project Description

This program takes the lengths of the two perpendicular sides of a right triangle as input from the user and computes the length of the hypotenuse. It uses the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

## Features

- User inputs for the lengths of the two perpendicular sides.
- Calculation of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.
- Display of the calculated hypotenuse to the user.

## How to Run

To run this application, you need to have Java installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Download the `JavaApplication26.java` file to your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you have saved the file.
4. Compile the Java file by running `javac JavaApplication26.java`.
5. Execute the compiled Java program by running `java JavaApplication26`.
6. Enter the lengths of the two sides when prompted.
